'''
Augmentation Pipeline for 2D Cardiac MRI Segmentation

Augmentation and transformations using the Albumentations library:
1) Spatial transforms (eg. flip, rotate) apply to both image and mask
2) Intensity transforms (eg. brightness, normalisation) apply to the image only
3) additional_targets={'mask': 'mask'} ensures correct transformation handling for masks

Purpose:
- Applies spatial and intensity-based data augmentations to training images and masks.
- Ensures consistent resizing and normalisation across train, validation, and test sets.
- Maintains pixel-wise alignment between MRI images and their segmentation masks.
- Converts both images and masks into PyTorch tensors for training segmentation models.
- Designed specifically for 2D slice-based cardiac MRI segmentation tasks.
